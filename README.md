# MvcMovie
 This is the "Movies" tutorial on how to use the MVC in C#

 ## Description
 This is Microsoft's tutorial on building an ASP.NET Core MVC App and overviews a variety of build components and utilities to use moving forward with C#. This App accesses a database and allows a user to interact with movie information from that database. This will be a reference for coming projects.
